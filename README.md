# Social Buttons for Twitter Bootstrap (v1.0.0)

**Clean (unofficial) social media buttons for Bootstrap 2 and 3 using Font Awesome.**

[See a live example](http://noizwaves.github.io/bootstrap-social-buttons/)

Social Buttons for Twitter Bootstrap is a plugin/mixin for Twitter Bootstrap that provides great looking (unofficial) themes for various social media buttons.

This works great with Font Awesome, which provides great looking icons for various <b>social media</b> actions.

Themes provided include:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Github
- Pinterest
- LinkedIn
- Google Plus
- Instragram
- and many more

## Requirements

- Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 (although older versions should be fine too) or Twitter Bootstrap 3.
- Font Awesome 4.0.3 (again, older versions should be fine).

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repo, if you are using CSS then:

Note: when using Bootstrap 3, use 'social-buttons-3.{ext}' instead of 'social-buttons.{ext}'!

1. Include Bootstrap and Font Awesome in your app (see [this guide](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#tab_fontawesome))
2. Include social-buttons.css in your app
3. Start using buttons!

Or if you are using LESS then:
1. Ensure Font Awesome is imported into your app (as CSS or LESS)
2. Import social-buttons.less into bootstrap.less
3. Build Bootstrap
4. Start using buttons.

Note: if you want to use Font Awesome, you should disable the icons mixin (by removing the sprites.less import in bootstrap.less).
