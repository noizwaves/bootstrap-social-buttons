# Social Buttons for Twitter Bootstrap (v1.0.0)

**Clean (unofficial) social media buttons for Bootstrap 2 and 3 using Font Awesome.**

[See a live example](http://noizwaves.github.io/bootstrap-social-buttons/)

Social Buttons for Twitter Bootstrap is a plugin/mixin for Twitter Bootstrap that provides great looking (unofficial) themes for various social media buttons.

This works great with Font Awesome, which provides great looking icons for various social media actions.

Themes provided include:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Github
- Pinterest
- LinkedIn
- Google Plus
- Instragram
- and many more

## Requirements

- Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 (although older versions should be fine too) or Twitter Bootstrap 3.
- Font Awesome 4.0.3 (again, older versions should be fine).

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repo, if you are using CSS then:

Note: when using Bootstrap 3, use 'social-buttons-3.{ext}' instead of 'social-buttons.{ext}'!

1. Include Bootstrap and Font Awesome in your app (see [this guide](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#tab_fontawesome))
2. Include social-buttons.css in your app
3. Start using buttons!

Or if you are using LESS then:
1. Ensure Font Awesome is imported into your app (as CSS or LESS)
2. Import social-buttons.less into bootstrap.less
3. Build Bootstrap
4. Start using buttons.

Note: if you want to use Font Awesome, you should disable the icons mixin (by removing the sprites.less import in bootstrap.less).
